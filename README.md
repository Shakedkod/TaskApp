# TASK APP
an application for my tasks (that half works beacuse i dont have the time to fix the not working part)

## Fetures:
* creating tasks
* viewing tasks

## Build
download [flutter](https://flutter.dev) and run `flutter doctor` to ckeck that you have all of the flutter dependencies.
go to the folder and run these commands:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
1. gets the packages (like npm install)
2. runs the flutter application(supposed to work in windows, but if dosen't you will need an android emulator or device)
